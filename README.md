# vacanciesToGA
An application to scrape the number of vacancies available on "https://keser.nl/vacature" and create a pageview with the number as a parameter. With doing so, GTM can pick it up and create an event.

Make sure "https://buildpack-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/buildpacks/jontewks/puppeteer.tgz" is added when using heroku.
